#All Sorts

This is an app for [reddit pygame challange](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/6gg260/challenge_all_sorts/)


**controls** 
press pg.K_1 ~ pg.K_0 for sorting these flags 'on the fly' :) 

**ps** 
all the flag images are from web, but I do not know why 'Angola' is missing, so I made it
